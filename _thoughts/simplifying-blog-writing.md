I started my website with simple HTML files, but adding new blog posts quickly became tedious. Every new post meant creating an HTML file, copying layout code, and manually updating the homepage with links.
I migrated to Jekyll, which automatically converts Markdown files into a complete website. Now when I create a new post, Jekyll detects it and updates the homepage automatically. All posts use consistent formatting without copying code.
After struggling with CMS authentication issues, I settled on writing posts directly in GitHub. I can create or edit posts from the web interface or mobile app, and Cloudflare automatically rebuilds the site in a few minutes.
This workflow is reliable, fast, and lets me focus on writing instead of wrestling with publishing tools. The combination of Jekyll, GitHub, and Cloudflare gives me the simplicity of Markdown with the power of automated site generation.
