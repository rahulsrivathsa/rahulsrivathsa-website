## Overview

I'm building an intelligent chatbot that can answer questions about my work, interests, and projects. This project serves as both a useful tool for visitors and a learning experience for me to understand how AI integration works in web applications.

The chatbot will be able to provide information about my background, current projects, and thoughts on various topics - essentially acting as an interactive version of this website.

## What I'm Building

- A conversational interface that understands questions about my work
- Integration with AI services to provide intelligent responses
- A clean, simple chat interface that matches this website's aesthetic
- Context awareness about my projects and interests

## What I'm Learning

- How to integrate AI APIs into web applications
- Building interactive chat interfaces with JavaScript
- Handling user input and dynamic content updates
- Deploying applications to subdomains
- Managing conversation context and state

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** As a beginner, understanding how to connect frontend interfaces with AI services seemed overwhelming.

**Solution:** Breaking it down into smaller steps - first building a simple chat interface, then adding the AI integration piece by piece.

**Challenge:** Making the chatbot knowledgeable about my specific work and interests.

**Solution:** Planning to train it on the content from this website and my project descriptions.

## Next Steps

- Complete the basic chat interface
- Integrate with an AI service
- Test and refine the conversation quality
- Deploy to chatbot.rahulsrivathsa.com
- Add more sophisticated context understanding

## Reflections

This project is teaching me a lot about the intersection of AI and web development. Even though I'm just starting out, I'm realizing that building AI-powered applications doesn't require being an AI expert - it's more about understanding how to connect different pieces together effectively.

The most valuable part of this project has been learning to break down complex ideas into manageable, buildable pieces. Each small step forward builds confidence for the next challenge.
